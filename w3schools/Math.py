# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:
x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)

print(x)
print(y)

# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
x = abs(-7.25)

print(x)

# The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).
x = pow(4, 3)

print(x)


# Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.
import math

x = math.sqrt(64)

print(x)
# The sqrt just finds the square root of the number you input
# Math ceil rounds upwards to its nearest integer
# Math floor round downwards to its nearest integer
# pi makes the return value as the value of pi
